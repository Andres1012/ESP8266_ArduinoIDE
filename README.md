#Purpose

This is a package to enable original Arduino IDE support ESP8266 MCU as target processor.
The supported Arduino IDE version is 1.6.1+. It can be taken from here: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
Currently only Windows version of the IDE is supported.

If you don't see the board then you probably unpacked package into wrong location.
