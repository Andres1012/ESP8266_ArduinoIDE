It can be taken from here: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software\r\nCurrently only Windows version of the IDE is supported.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThe work is based on Anakod's Sming framework: https://github.com/anakod/Sming \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nDownload the repo as archive and unpack it to hardware subfolder of Arduino's sketchbook location. Alternatively clone repository into the hardware subfolder.\r\n[img]\r\n\r\nAfter that start Arduino IDE. You should see ESP8266 in boards menu available for selection:\r\n[img]\r\n\r\nIf you don't see the board then you probably unpacked package into wrong location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
